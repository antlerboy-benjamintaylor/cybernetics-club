### Session 2 Reading Context

Norman Weiner: Introduction to Cyubernetics

##### Newtonian Time, Bergsonian Time
- Reversability of time
- Consistent values only exist within ‘Newtonian Time’
- N-Time is purist, more abstracted
	- when astronomy is dug into, not everything is as clean as N-time points to
	- Playing videos of planetary movement makes sense in reverse, cloud formation makes no structural sense if recorded and played in reverse
- Was the text written before Chaos Theory
- Nondeterminism, was that what Weiner was thinking about? Trying to describe?
- Which decade/time did Nondeterminism become popular around?
- Chaos Theory
	- Undecuts the ability to predict a system given a shorter time span
- Bates, Metalogues: Parent and Daughter
	- Why are there only a small amount of ways to be tidy, why are there so many ways to be messy?
	- Probabilistically, it’s more likely that a given system will be messier vs. cleaner.
- Two Joint Pendulum problem:
	- If you swing it, it’s impossible to predict where it will go
	- Three body problem: It’s impossible to predict how the three will interact with one another.
- Classic Mechanics deals with large bodies, is (largely) considered incompatible with Quantum mechanics
- Power Model vs. Communicative Model of Energy
	- A letter contains so much more than the ‘sum of its parts’
	- Organisms fall into various camps that are able to regulate themselves in various ways
	- Adapters, Regulators, Exo-regulators
- Directionality of time:
    - Communicating with someone existing in reverse time would be impossible.
    - [One-Electron Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-electron_universe)
        - John Wheeler to Richard Feynman: Why are electrons all the same/similar?:
        - It’s one electron appearing all throughout time

##### To Our Friends:

- Anarchist academics interested in Gordon’s works and its’ dealings with ‘Self Regulation’
- Ask for 
- ToF not fan of John Newman
- Cybernetics as a method of thinking was used in its earliest days to construct systems of warfare, bomb guidance systems, boat steering mechanisms, etc.
	- It’s easy to see how ToF would not be a fan of cybernetics given this origin.
- Cybernetics is the science of government
- You should care about why social networking exists because if you don’t participate in it, you may end up being distinctive or targeted.
	- Note: Link to DISMAgazine article on ‘hiding in a digital environment’
		- CV Dazzle
		- Online Suicide (liking as much as possible)
	- More and more, it’s less ‘social networks’ we need to worry about, it’s the deeper systems that are utilised by the government to identify a person
	- AirBNB uses ‘trust systems’ that are more and more ensnaring people in systems that require opting-in in order to be ‘a person’
	- The Black Stack/Stack, referenced by Morgan
		- Slavoj?
	- “If you let everyone have a voice, is freedom of speech worthless?”
- Censorship, Self Imposed
	- We create censorship via our own practices/phone-carrying
	- Liberal Government is a background power that rules over interests vs. bodies.
	- It’s the feedback loop between self-governing & external governing

##### Bateson: Definition of Cybernetics

- Melanie: self-organizing, interconnected system
- distributed self-support regulation
- self-regulate via feedback w/o authoritarian input

- Economic Intervention via the ‘West’ has fucked up other countries
- This American Life Episode: ‘Big Pile of Money(sic)’
- ****** Where do you invest your skillset? How do you remain optimistic when the world is run on undersea cables? Where do you reconcile? 
- Money flows into desire — Money’s dream/desire is to flow freely
- ‘Cybernetic’ Economic Flow:
	- Which decisions to I make to keep a system in check? In equilibrium?
- Cybernetics focuses on the negative explanation of things:
	- Utilizing the letter ‘K’ is excluding all other letters in its’ place.
	- In cybernetics, all solutions are regulated
- How do I approach the world? Do I remain optimistic? Do I become a pessimist?
	- Perhaps we can think of our world as enacting the proper form of restraints
- In smaller (non-American countries), their upload pipes are much smaller than their download pipes — this results in the export of their culture being much more hard to do, while American culture (potentially) overwhelms them
	- Still a very real problem in Venuzuela via government blocking.
- Uber has had to rebuild their entire tech stack in China, had to rebuild a copy within the limits of China’s regulations

#### Session Three
###### July 20 2016

-

##### Social traps/behavioral economics
Social traps is like behavioral economics - but it was written before

BE > study of how irrational behavior affects economic decisions
BE > cutting edge is how human behaviors shape not just socioeconomics but culture

Thinking fast and slow > BE basics > probability and how psychology affects decision making/prediction

Rational model of human behavior in classic economics comes from a strong desire like physics to represent humans in equations

Greek economics person > extremist book

Steady state economics - another book - also ripping on it

The Weird Problem > western educated industrialized rich developed. Kahnemans main theory > we value risk for potential gains diff from losses. Is that bc in western culture only? 

A lot of BE is focused on microeconomics bc it's not trying to take this world lens bc each culture needs its own studies

Social traps touches on game theory. Public goods game - play w group of people, give everyone same money, u can put any amount into communal pot, it gets doubled in pot. Best outcome is u keep yours but everyone else puts theirs in. In India depending on the caste of the people the behaviors are diff, eg high playing w low vs high playing w high

##### World Game/Cybersyn/Simulations
World game
Was it ever made? Most sim games these days like civ seem to end up in the opposite results where u end up being more destructive. 

Les simerables
The way games are made always have presupposed solutions eg high crime > solve by adding police statins. @Criticaldistance same critique on civ

In social traps the dollar game was a good simulation to go thru of once u go thru it u learn the lesson once. What if we all went thru all these lessons and formed a baseline. Would there just be more problems? What if u learn the wrong lesson?

Wicked problem > attempting the solution changes the context. Cannot iterate. Forestry > can simulate but what will happen after the simulation > can't simulate that. Unknown unknowns. 
How do you know you're accounting for all the things and their relations when thinking about the world economy?

Feedback loop is ignorance

Intuition/gut via pattern finding. ML > about finding patterns. Humans are good at patterns up to a certain point

Backlash against experts bc even they can get it wrong so lost faith in experts. Brexit. Huge distrust in scientific professionals. Metaphors as the best way to think about solutions to wicked problems

Wicked problems > you may agree w people on a problem but totally disagree on solutions. If u ask a police chief how to reduce crime > give us more guns > Micro level perspective

Cybersyn
Top line metric of GDP (result/lagging indicator) vs employment (current day to day experience).
Stafford Beer > main person for cybersyn. Lots of YouTube videos of him. 

Variety outside cybernetics > choice. Within cybernetics variety is all the possible states of a system. A system that has these infinite variety causes wicked problems. Paper: will of the paper > humans have infinite states > We've all agreed to limit our variety to have this reading group. We're limiting our free will to have some social/ public good. Social norms

Simulation uncanny valley > dangers of being too real. Machine learning > money laundering for bias. Can be used in nefarious purposes

Symptomology > diagnose what's happening instead of reducing it to something. Centralizing all signals to one place seems to defeat the purpose. Huge assumption that u can model things in a centralizable way

Big data > current assumption for a lot of companies to make decisions based on these simplified metrics. sometimes u can't reduce it down

##### Navigating neoliberalism/representing big data
Is there some way to build cognitive maps of a broad system like neoliberalism. 

Tangent. Erbit guy obsessed w tsarist russia: 3 political systems > oligarchy, democracy, monarchy. Benevolent dictator is best. That's a simple decision to reason. Only one chair in control room. Erbit > design philosophy is like parliamentary democracy. If u buy in you'll be able to make decisions

Eve online > not much conflict bc everyone's so afraid to fight. Everything's in spreadsheets bc you've invested so much into it

Prime people triggers bias > if u remind someone they're african American they do worse (via question at beginning about your ethnicity) or female or low caste. Default options are really powerful > organ donor default == lives saved 

To think you've solved a wicked problem is failing. 

Feedback loops today are v fast. Feedback loop in capitalism if u don't correct internally u are corrected externally by the company failing

Phillip tedlock > research on IBankers politicians etc asking them to predict stuff. Super forecasting > wrote a book that if u ask a large group of amateurs they will most often be just as right as experts.

Death of the expert > having domain expertise in a global context may be more damaging. When seeing outliers experts discount instead of restructuring their model
Or like economists who "don't deal w psychology stuff"

Seeing like a state > narrow mindedness and oversimplification bad

Nav neoliberalism > At first art is jarring/puzzling but when it clicks u think differently. Act of thinking triggers new thinking. Not necessarily tied to input. 

Would've been contradictory for wicked problems doc to present solutions

Francis - Simulations aren't to prove anything. Project is good for counter factual thinking. see how things could play out. It's a thinking tool —doesn't have to be accurate

Real danger is when we stop envisioning future. 

Milton Friedman - pencil that's comes from everywhere. All the crazy systems behind it are hidden from us. Is there a way to make it clear that this device went thru all these systems/sequence of events

There's a mobile game where u go thru the levels of how the phone is made. The Phone Story. 

Venezuela - after 15 years of socialism it's destroyed the economy. Simple things like eggs are super scarce. Can only buy on black market or state controlled goods where u line up for six hours. Citizens have a unintelligible chronicle of how they got to this point in their head. It's a ton of reasons why - impossible to simplify to one. It's not complicated but it's complex

Convenience obscures how things came to be

Food inc 1.5h vs living something for years. Hollywood - the way to explain a complicated thing is to dumb it down to a simple emotional appeal/disappeal. You don't have a complex understanding but u have clear next steps to take. Short circuits the process

Or other films like inside job > render u to anger/loss of power to take action bc it's beyond you to fix Wall Street. Abstractions upon abstractions that aren't tied to physical assets eg credit

Beowulf cluster - brambles of raspberry pi.
