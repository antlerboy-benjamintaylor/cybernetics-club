##### Social traps/behavioral economics

Social traps is like behavioral economics - but it was written before

BE > study of how irrational behavior affects economic decisions
BE > cutting edge is how human behaviors shape not just socioeconomics but culture

World Bank has gotten onto BE. [World Development Report 2015](http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/wdr2015) all about it. Melanie's mom is involved with this.

Thinking fast and slow > BE basics > probability and how psychology affects decision making/prediction

Rational model of human behavior in classic economics comes from a strong desire like physics to represent humans in equations

Yanis Varoufakis (Greek economics person) > extremist book, rips on rational actor model

Steady state economics - another book - also ripping on it

The Weird Problem > western educated industrialized rich developed. Kahnemans main theory > we value risk for potential gains diff from losses. Is that bc in western culture only?

A lot of BE is focused on microeconomics bc it's not trying to take this world lens bc each culture needs its own studies

Social traps touches on game theory. Public goods game - play w group of people, give everyone same money, u can put any amount into communal pot, it gets doubled in pot. Best outcome is u keep yours but everyone else puts theirs in. In India depending on the caste of the people the behaviors are diff, eg high playing w low vs high playing w high

Agent-based modeling in social sciences.


##### World Game/Cybersyn/Simulations

###### World game

Was it ever made? Most sim games these days like civ seem to end up in the opposite results where u end up being more destructive.

[Les simerables](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2014/10/les-simerables/)
The way games are made always have presupposed solutions eg high crime > solve by adding police statins. @Criticaldistance same critique on civ

In social traps the dollar game was a good simulation to go thru of once u go thru it u learn the lesson once. What if we all went thru all these lessons and formed a baseline. Would there just be more problems? What if u learn the wrong lesson?

Wicked problem > attempting the solution changes the context. Cannot iterate. Forestry > can simulate but what will happen after the simulation > can't simulate that. Unknown unknowns.
How do you know you're accounting for all the things and their relations when thinking about the world economy?

Feedback loop is ignorance

Possible ways forward given poor feedback loops. Intuition/gut via pattern finding. ML > about finding patterns. Humans are good at patterns up to a certain point

Backlash against experts bc even they can get it wrong so lost faith in experts. Brexit. [Glen Greenwald on Brexit](https://theintercept.com/2016/06/25/brexit-is-only-the-latest-proof-of-the-insularity-and-failure-of-western-establishment-institutions/) Huge distrust in scientific professionals. Metaphors as the best way to think about solutions to wicked problems

Wicked problems > you may agree w people on a problem but totally disagree on solutions. If u ask a police chief how to reduce crime > give us more guns (hammer/nail) > Micro level perspective

###### Cybersyn

Top line metric of GDP (result/lagging indicator) vs employment (current day to day experience).
Stafford Beer > main person for cybersyn. Lots of YouTube videos of him. He has a big beard and is fun to watch.

Variety outside cybernetics > choice. Within cybernetics variety is all the possible states of a system. A system that has these infinite variety causes wicked problems. Paper: will of the paper > humans have infinite states > We've all agreed to limit our variety to have this reading group. We're limiting our free will to have some social/public good. Social norms/society as example of voluntary unfreedom.

Simulation uncanny valley > dangers of being too real. Machine learning > money laundering for bias. Can be used in nefarious purposes. Analogy to overfitting in ML?

Symptomology > diagnose what's happening instead of reducing it to something. Centralizing all signals to one place seems to defeat the purpose. Huge assumption that u can model things in a centralizable way.

Big data > current assumption for a lot of companies to make decisions based on these simplified metrics. sometimes u can't reduce it down

##### Navigating neoliberalism/representing big data
Is there some way to build cognitive maps of a broad system like neoliberalism.

Tangent. Denis met Curtis Yarvin (Urbit guy) and talked with him; he is obsessed w tsarist russia: 3 political systems > oligarchy, democracy, monarchy. Benevolent dictator is best. That's a simple decision to reason. Only one chair in control room. Urbit > design philosophy is like parliamentary democracy (House of Lords). If you buy in you'll be able to make decisions.

Eve online > not much conflict bc everyone's so afraid to fight. Everything's in spreadsheets bc you've invested so much into it. Analogy to World Game?

Prime people triggers bias > if u remind someone they're african American they do worse (via question at beginning about your ethnicity) or female or low caste. Default options are really powerful > organ donor default == lives saved

[Harvard Implicit bias test](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html). Bias training risks being shallow, self-absolving, I 'dealt with it' by just thinking about it? Shallow "woke" perspective. Individual bias vs. institutional bias.

To think you've solved a wicked problem is failing.

Feedback loops today are v fast. Feedback loop in capitalism if u don't correct internally u are corrected externally by the company failing

Phillip Tetlock > research on IBankers politicians etc asking them to predict stuff. Super forecasting > wrote a book that if u ask a large group of amateurs they will most often be just as right as experts. [Freakonomics podcast episode](http://freakonomics.com/podcast/how-to-be-less-terrible-at-predicting-the-future-a-new-freakonomics-radio-podcast/) about his research.

Death of the expert > having domain expertise in a global context may be more damaging. When seeing outliers experts discount instead of restructuring their model
Or like economists who "don't deal w psychology stuff"

Seeing like a state > narrow mindedness and oversimplification bad

Nav neoliberalism > At first art is jarring/puzzling but when it clicks u think differently. Act of thinking triggers new thinking. Not necessarily tied to input.

Would've been contradictory for wicked problems doc to present solutions. Like a Zen koan.

Zen koans and art jar the mind of neoliberalism?

Francis - Simulations aren't to prove anything. Project is good for counter factual thinking. see how things could play out. It's a thinking tool â€”doesn't have to be accurate

Real danger is when we stop envisioning future. Role of art is to visualize (disastrous) futures?

Milton Friedman show on PBS (Reagan era) [Free to Choose](http://www.freetochoose.tv/broadcasts/ftc80.php) - pencil that's comes from everywhere. All the crazy systems behind it are hidden from us. Is there a way to make it clear that this device went thru all these systems/sequence of events.

There's a mobile game where u go thru the levels of how the phone is made. [The Phone Story](http://www.phonestory.org/game.html).

Venezuela - after 15 years of socialism it's destroyed the economy. Simple things like eggs are super scarce. Can only buy on black market or state controlled goods where u line up for six hours. Citizens have a unintelligible chronicle of how they got to this point in their head. It's a ton of reasons why - impossible to simplify to one. Slow creep of changes over time. It's not complex but it's complicated.

Convenience obscures how things came to be.

Food inc 1.5h vs living something for years. Hollywood - the way to explain a complicated thing is to dumb it down to a simple emotional appeal/disappeal. You don't have a complex understanding but u have clear next steps to take. Short circuits the process.

Or other films like inside job > render u to anger/loss of power to take action bc it's beyond you to fix Wall Street. Abstractions upon abstractions that aren't tied to physical assets eg credit.

Joi Ito @ media lab -- work in encoding information into physical objects. Faucet that shows temperature via color. Legibility of objects.

Greenspan: Dutch disease -- oil resources can gut the rest of an economy if it is not already robust due to exchange rates. Applicability to Venezuela?

Local tiny datacenters. Beowulf cluster - brambles of raspberry pi.

[NYC Mesh](https://nycmesh.net/) developing mesh network. Efficiency of point-to-point networking vs. centralized dns/backbone system. [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) tackles this. So does Urbit.

Data and society?

Free basics. Failure in India, problems around net neutrality/centralization.
