Cybernetics Club — Session 4 

- - -

Pre-meeting:

- Meta-topic: Reading is hard
	- Xanadu
	- Pilgrim
	- Select Leadership
	- No one has read all of the writings

- Functional Programming
	- Haskell
	- React && Stateful programming

First Topic: Size + Network Effects

- a ratio between quantities
- issues of scale in politics: what are the mismatched quantities
- network effects:
	- first third and last third were best to read
	- is network externality good? bad?
	- cooking and critical mass: the more a chef uses ingedients, the more peopel are exposed to them, and use them
	- Network Effects vs. Network Externalities
		- Net Effects — Change you insert into a system comes back to affect you
 		- Net Ex — Change you insert into a system does not affect you
- Examples used seemd to all be coordination games
- DVORAK vs. QWERTY keyboards: both the same exact (reconfigured) closed system (ed. note: find the exact language that describes this in introduction to cybernetics)
	- In a sense, each of these systems are the same system, but both are valued differently based on their market — their usage
- the utility of a massive platform does not affect/benefit individual users
- you consider network externalities as an individual
- if you’re the first person to buy a phone, your network ecternality is way way different than people who join later
	- Why would the first person to join the ‘phone network’ join the network?
- the moment of transition is where the value lies
- Chicken Little, Chicken and the Egg
- Elon Musk: The master plan
	- Tesla Autonomous Cars
	- Real Estate
	- In the future, AirBnb owns all Real Estate, Tesla owns all cars
	- Cars will hire people

Second Topic: Ator Network Theory

- Latour: Actor Network Theory
	- if you understand the world as netowrks, you’ll understand that all things chain together, the driver’s eye to a metal bolt.
	- This is a framework which says anyone/anything can be an actor

[I was missing for 5 min]

- Object-oriented ontology
	-  people who are interfacing with Latours theories
-  hierarchy can be mapped as a flat thing - non heirarchical 
-  Benevolent dictator of Singapore linked AC to national productivity, implemented his decision and everything was better.
-  instead of seeing where you are and seeing the details within it
-  e-flux: the internet does not exist
	-  not everything is connected equally
-  even in rhizomatic structures, some lines are traced thicker than others
-  The word ‘Network’
	-  comes from a french word, *figure this out later*

Digression:

-  Liminal Moments: Focoult
-  Duchamp’s Urinal, a special (networked) moment?
-  Consumer sensitivity to ‘New’ objects
-  Value: what is it?
-  Art market
	-  Acting on small scales
	-  Why not act on larger scales?
-  HexaYurt - dystopian structure builder
	-  foamboard and foil
	-  stronger than normal tents
	-  not bought into because it was too permanent
	-  big writer about ethereum and DAO
-  Burning Man alternative universe

Third Topic: Designing blahblahblah

- if you have a system and you are trying to keep a ball stable, the more people involved in the system, the harder it is to stabalize the ball
- the higher the variety in a system, the harder it is to control
- when a system is perturbed
- cybernetics, the science of control in animal and machine
- new definition: the science of affective organization
	- management-oriented definition
- ashby’s law of variety: in order to control variety, you need to add more reflective variety
- CyberSyn
- Pair piece: Variety from the manager is undesired
	- variety for the worker is wiggle room
- each of these things are intertwined

- what ties all of the readings:
	- all of the readings relate to how we deal with interrelated networks, how do we deal with the modern phenomenon that ‘everything is connected’?
	- it is a complex and networked world
	- cybernetics never become its own discipline because it has been subsumed by many other disciplines
	- disciplines should be definied by what they study, not how they study
		- cybernetics study: what is it? it’s a way of thinking of the world
		- cybernetics is a framework of talking about other disciplines and subjects in terms of actors and networks

- is there a degree of interconnectedness where heuristics cease to matter?

- wicked problems: things by with heuristics can’t assist any more

- when networks are thick, when they are too much, one can utilize a heuristic

- religion, a shared method of making decisions that are not changing as much as science, or as rooted as traditions.

- before cybernetics, you couldn’t reduce ideas into physics terms

- with cybernetics + feedback, you can define states you want to achieve, and feedback machanisms will ensure that.
  
Digression:

- How do you unpack causal + causality in machine learning?
	- causality in this arena is more complex than classic causility
- ProLog

- Humans learn by observation, machines learn by uploading data back into the brain.
	- cars will serve as examples to other cars in the future
	- cars will be humiliated and learn from each other if they make mistakes
