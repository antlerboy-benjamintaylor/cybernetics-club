### Session 2 Reading Context

Norman Weiner: Introduction to Cyubernetics

##### Newtonian Time, Bergsonian Time
- Reversability of time
- Consistent values only exist within ‘Newtonian Time’
- N-Time is purist, more abstracted
	- when astronomy is dug into, not everything is as clean as N-time points to
	- Playing videos of planetary movement makes sense in reverse, cloud formation makes no structural sense if recorded and played in reverse
- Was the text written before Chaos Theory
- Nondeterminism, was that what Weiner was thinking about? Trying to describe?
- Which decade/time did Nondeterminism become popular around?
- Chaos Theory
	- Undecuts the ability to predict a system given a shorter time span
- Bates, Metalogues: Parent and Daughter
	- Why are there only a small amount of ways to be tidy, why are there so many ways to be messy?
	- Probabilistically, it’s more likely that a given system will be messier vs. cleaner.
- Two Joint Pendulum problem:
	- If you swing it, it’s impossible to predict where it will go
	- Three body problem: It’s impossible to predict how the three will interact with one another.
- Classic Mechanics deals with large bodies, is (largely) considered incompatible with Quantum mechanics
- Power Model vs. Communicative Model of Energy
	- A letter contains so much more than the ‘sum of its parts’
	- Organisms fall into various camps that are able to regulate themselves in various ways
	- Adapters, Regulators, Exo-regulators
- Directionality of time:
    - Communicating with someone existing in reverse time would be impossible.
    - [One-Electron Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-electron_universe)
        - John Wheeler to Richard Feynman: Why are electrons all the same/similar?:
        - It’s one electron appearing all throughout time

##### To Our Friends:

- Anarchist academics interested in Gordon’s works and its’ dealings with ‘Self Regulation’
- Ask for 
- ToF not fan of John Newman
- Cybernetics as a method of thinking was used in its earliest days to construct systems of warfare, bomb guidance systems, boat steering mechanisms, etc.
	- It’s easy to see how ToF would not be a fan of cybernetics given this origin.
- Cybernetics is the science of government
- You should care about why social networking exists because if you don’t participate in it, you may end up being distinctive or targeted.
	- Note: Link to DISMAgazine article on ‘hiding in a digital environment’
		- CV Dazzle
		- Online Suicide (liking as much as possible)
	- More and more, it’s less ‘social networks’ we need to worry about, it’s the deeper systems that are utilised by the government to identify a person
	- AirBNB uses ‘trust systems’ that are more and more ensnaring people in systems that require opting-in in order to be ‘a person’
	- The Black Stack/Stack, referenced by Morgan
		- Slavoj?
	- “If you let everyone have a voice, is freedom of speech worthless?”
- Censorship, Self Imposed
	- We create censorship via our own practices/phone-carrying
	- Liberal Government is a background power that rules over interests vs. bodies.
	- It’s the feedback loop between self-governing & external governing

- ****** Where do you invest your skillset? How do you remain optimistic when the world is run on undersea cables? Where do you reconcile? 
- Money flows into desire — Money’s dream/desire is to flow freely
- ‘Cybernetic’ Economic Flow:
	- Which decisions to I make to keep a system in check? In equilibrium?
- Cybernetics focuses on the negative explanation of things:
	- Utilizing the letter ‘K’ is excluding all other letters in its’ place.
	- In cybernetics, all solutions are regulated
- How do I approach the world? Do I remain optimistic? Do I become a pessimist?
	- Perhaps we can think of our world as enacting the proper form of restraints
- In smaller (non-American countries), their upload pipes are much smaller than their download pipes — this results in the export of their culture being much more hard to do, while American culture (potentially) overwhelms them

- Which communication is *only* possible via technology?
- Was the written word a reductive technoology?
- THe single letter K implies so much (via question-asking), who wrote it, did two people write it, what was excluded with the inscribing of the letter, etc.
- Elon Musk: Our ability to input knowledge is so much greater than our output capabilities

##### Systems Thinking: ‘Cybernetics’?
