##### Session 2
###### 21 June 2016

- The first chapter of Wiener's Cybernetics, called [Newtonian and Bergsonian Time](reading/session-2/Norbert_Wiener_Cybernetics.pdf) seems foundational for whatever we go on to read.

- I'm finding Bateson very interesting; I think the article [Cybernetic Explanation](Gregory_Bateson_Ecology_of_Mind.pdf) (in part V of Steps to an Ecology of Mind) is actually a more cogent account of the cybernetic approach to the sciences than anything I've read yet in Wiener.

- Another from Bateson: [The Role of Somatic Change in Evolution](Gregory_Bateson_Ecology_of_Mind.pdf) (in part IV of Steps...). In this paper he lays out a hypothesis about the interaction of several types of variation in evolution. The direct argument is pretty fascinating, and at a meta level it's a perfect example of cybernetic deduction in action.

- Francis, I am happy you mentioned All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace, I literally just learned about it this evening in conversation with Mehan. Let's put that on the list: <https://vimeo.com/groups/96331/videos/80799352> ... this episode appears to be a cautionary tale about mistaking maps for territory.
