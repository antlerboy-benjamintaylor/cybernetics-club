### Session 2 Reading Context

Norman Weiner: Introduction to Cyubernetics

##### Newtonian Time, Bergsonian Time
- Reversability of time
- Consistent values only exist within ‘Newtonian Time’
- N-Time is purist, more abstracted
	- when astronomy is dug into, not everything is as clean as N-time points to
	- Playing videos of planetary movement makes sense in reverse, cloud formation makes no structural sense if recorded and played in reverse
- Was the text written before Chaos Theory
- Nondeterminism, was that what Weiner was thinking about? Trying to describe?
- Which decade/time did Nondeterminism become popular around?
- Chaos Theory
	- Undecuts the ability to predict a system given a shorter time span
- Bates, Metalogues: Parent and Daughter
	- Why are there only a small amount of ways to be tidy, why are there so many ways to be messy?
	- Probabilistically, it’s more likely that a given system will be messier vs. cleaner.
- Two Joint Pendulum problem:
	- If you swing it, it’s impossible to predict where it will go
	- Three body problem: It’s impossible to predict how the three will interact with one another.
- Classic Mechanics deals with large bodies, is (largely) considered incompatible with Quantum mechanics
- Power Model vs. Communicative Model of Energy
	- A letter contains so much more than the ‘sum of its parts’
	- Organisms fall into various camps that are able to regulate themselves in various ways
	- Adapters, Regulators, Exo-regulators
- Directionality of time:
    - Communicating with someone existing in reverse time would be impossible.
    - [One-Electron Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-electron_universe)
        - John Wheeler to Richard Feynman: Why are electrons all the same/similar?:
        - It’s one electron appearing all throughout time

##### To Our Friends:

- Anarchist academics interested in Gordon’s works and its’ dealings with ‘Self Regulation’
- Ask for
- ToF not fan of John Newman
- Cybernetics as a method of thinking was used in its earliest days to construct systems of warfare, bomb guidance systems, boat steering mechanisms, etc.
	- It’s easy to see how ToF would not be a fan of cybernetics given this origin.
- Cybernetics is the science of government
- You should care about why social networking exists because if you don’t participate in it, you may end up being distinctive or targeted.
	- Note: Link to DISMAgazine article on ‘hiding in a digital environment’
		- CV Dazzle
		- Online Suicide (liking as much as possible)
	- More and more, it’s less ‘social networks’ we need to worry about, it’s the deeper systems that are utilised by the government to identify a person
	- AirBNB uses ‘trust systems’ that are more and more ensnaring people in systems that require opting-in in order to be ‘a person’
	- The Black Stack/Stack, referenced by Morgan
		- Slavoj?
	- “If you let everyone have a voice, is freedom of speech worthless?”
- Censorship, Self Imposed
	- We create censorship via our own practices/phone-carrying
	- Liberal Government is a background power that rules over interests vs. bodies.
	- It’s the feedback loop between self-governing & external governing

##### Bateson: Definition of Cybernetics

- Melanie: self-organizing, interconnected system
- distributed self-support regulation
- self-regulate via feedback w/o authoritarian input
- Urbit: A harkening back to traditional utopian computing?
	- Computing as ‘Real estate’
	- Everyone’s Collective hardware can be utilised to support *my* software
- Ask Irene to link to WIRED article on internet cables
	- NSA can monitor internet traffic at incredibly low levels
	- How can we seperate our processes from hardware?
	- Encryption problem
- Machines of Loving Grace
- Alan Greenspan
	- Federal reserve chairman for many terms
- Federal Reserve
	- Fed Reserve takes control of long-term economical decisions
	- handle bailouts, interest rates, etc.
- Cable-cutting is not a globally-viable decision
- Economic Intervention via the ‘West’ has fucked up other countries
- This American Life Episode: ‘Big Pile of Money(sic)’
- ****** Where do you invest your skillset? How do you remain optimistic when the world is run on undersea cables? Where do you reconcile?
- Money flows into desire — Money’s dream/desire is to flow freely
- ‘Cybernetic’ Economic Flow:
	- Which decisions to I make to keep a system in check? In equilibrium?
- Cybernetics focuses on the negative explanation of things:
	- Utilizing the letter ‘K’ is excluding all other letters in its’ place.
	- In cybernetics, all solutions are regulated
- How do I approach the world? Do I remain optimistic? Do I become a pessimist?
	- Perhaps we can think of our world as enacting the proper form of restraints
- In smaller (non-American countries), their upload pipes are much smaller than their download pipes — this results in the export of their culture being much more hard to do, while American culture (potentially) overwhelms them
	- Still a very real problem in Venuzuela via government blocking.
- Uber has had to rebuild their entire tech stack in China, had to rebuild a copy within the limits of China’s regulations
- Lapka: Designer started w/ a shitty computer and photoshop
	- Does luxury development trickle down into cheaper devices? More affordable and accessible tech?
	- LAPKA: Scientific instruments made to be beautiful, accessible, easy to use.
- Cybernetics and Reproducability — we should learn about this
- The Construction of the human body as the whole of many small parts
- Jaron Lanier
	- Coined VR
	- weirdo
	- lives in Silicon Valley, but is definitely an outsider
- You don’t think what you can’t communicate with ‘SMS’
- Facebook ‘Reactions’ as building the desire path, but still being fundamentally constrained
- Heidegger
- Zadie Smith
- Which communication is *only* possible via technology?
- Was the written word a reductive technoology?
- THe single letter K implies so much (via question-asking), who wrote it, did two people write it, what was excluded with the inscribing of the letter, etc.
- Elon Musk: Our ability to input knowledge is so much greater than our output capabilities

##### Systems Thinking: ‘Cybernetics’?

- many modern digital design practices utilize bits and pieces of what constitutes the entire body of knowledge that cybernetics comprises
- is this dangerous?
- can people re-take cybernetics back as a system for improving the world?
- Extracurricular: ’Hippie Modernism’
- Undeveloped forms of utopianisms
- The episode was a warning call to mis-appropriating one sphere of knowledge to another.
- Afro-futurism
- Le Corbusier: The Open Hand, scan in the article aboue chandrigar, planned cities, utopianism


- The DAO
	- “Decentralised Autonomus Organization”
	- Smart contracts are contracts written in code
	- A bug in the DAO smart contract allowed a user to siphon out money, since it was allowable in code
	- Forking the system: Should the majority decide that the hack was law?
	- If you visit a legal library, you’re gazing at the Code
	- Distinction between meatspace and cyberspace is still rampant in cryptocurrency world

		- You can reduce the actions that you take to determine if they are good
		- Relativism (80s + 90s idealogy)
		- “Pragmatic ALtruism”
	- Network effect and Scale
